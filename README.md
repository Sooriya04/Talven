# Talven

**Talven** is a minimalist, privacy-respecting meta-search API. Designed to be a simple, pure interface to the world's information, stripped of all distractions.

## About

Talven focuses solely on providing search results via a clean JSON API, making it the perfect backend for custom search applications, AI agents, and data analysis tools.

## Why Talven?

SearXNG is an excellent privacy-respecting metasearch engine, but it is primarily built as a standalone web application with a user interface.

**Talven was created to solve a different problem:** the need for a powerful, self-hosted search API **without the frontend overhead.**

By stripping away the UI, templates, and static assets, Talven becomes a lightweight, pure-backend solution optimized for:

- **AI & LLM Agents**: Providing real-time web access to Large Language Models (RAG).
- **Custom Interfaces**: Developers who want to build their own UI on top of a robust search engine.
- **Data Pipelines**: Programmatic access to aggregated search results from multiple sources.

## Credits & Attribution

This project is built upon the incredible work of the open-source community.
